      <p className="sans">
        I grew up around computers and built my cities website when I was 14.
        Since then, I've worked in construction, went back to school for CS, and
        interned at Last.fm and OU's Office of Technology.
      </p>
      <p className="sans">
        Over the last year, I started pushing myself out of my coding comfort
        zone. Every week I apply a new technology to a project and document
        what I learn. My goal with this site is to leave a ladder behind for
        others who share a similar passion for project-based learning.
      </p>

        I highly recommend Daniel. He has helped me with my growing to become a
        local industry leader. He developed my website and built customized
        payment software. He studied my competitors and gave me suggestions for
        marketing strategies, SEO ranking, and much more.<br />
