        I'm a software engineer passionate about developing ideas into 1s and

      <p className="sans">
        I grew up around computers and built my cities website when I was 14.
        Since then, I've worked in construction, went back to school for CS, and
        interned at Last.fm and OU's Office of Technology.
      </p>
      <p className="sans">
        Over the last year, I started pushing myself out of my coding comfort
        zone. I try to learn something new every week through a project. My goal
        with this site is to leave a ladder behind for others who share a similar
        passion for project-based learning.
      </p>
      {/*<blockquote>
        I highly recommend Daniel. He has helped me with my growing to become a
        local industry leader. He developed my website and built customized
        payment software. He studied my competitors and gave me suggestions for
        marketing strategies, SEO ranking, and much more.<br />

        Feel free to reach out on any of the listed platforms. I'll be open to
        new professional opportunities in August 2020.
