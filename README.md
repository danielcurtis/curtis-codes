# Curtis Codes

This is my personal portfolio website where I track what I know and write about
software engineering.

I used Gatsby, React, Apollo, and MDX to build the site and Netlify for
continuous deployment.

Feel free to clone my site to build a similar portfolio! While the code itself
is licensed under the MIT license, my content (articles, projects) are not. I 
reserve all rights to my projects, ideas, and content shared on my website.
