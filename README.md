# Curtis-Codes

My personal portfolio designed after Windows 98 - the year I was born :D

I built this website with Gatsby with the hope of turning it into a full-fledged blog one day. I also use React (of course), GraphQL, and 98.css.

The website is hosted using a CI/CD pipeline using Netlify and GitHub Actions.

## License

I would love to make this website open source. However, I use an API for my articles which would create security issues.

## Local Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Develop by running `gastby develop`
4. Build by running `gatsby build`
